I am proud to announce the completion of my Facebook clone project. This replica features essential components such as a signup page, login page, and homepage, where users can interact by liking posts. Leveraging React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM library, and React Icons library, I have meticulously crafted each aspect to mirror the functionality and design of the original platform.
